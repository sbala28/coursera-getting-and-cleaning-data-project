This repository contains the following files:

* README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
* tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
* CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
* run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set
